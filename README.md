# Robot

This is a school excercise made with robot framework and selenium library. The target was to train automated testing with forementioned systems. 

The robot is just logging into the Swag lab shop. First with problem_user and after going to checkout it will log out. It will try ordering desirable products again but now with standard_user. After successful checkout the browser will be closed.
